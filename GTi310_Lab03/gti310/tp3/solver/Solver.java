 * The Solver interface presents a method definition to complete a given task.
 * The Solver uses the output produced by a Parser object and returns an
 * object. The object is not defined to allow greater flexibility. On the
 * downside, the added flexibility also bring disadvantages. The caster must
 * know the type of the object that will be returned by the Solver beforehand.

 *  handing in the data.
