 * The Writer interface defines a method to write user-defined objects to file.
 * The classes implementing the Writer interface should explicitaly define the
 * object they will be wrinting to file.

 * 		public class MyWriter implements Writer<MyObject> { ... }
 * 
 * The caller will need to know what type of objects it will be writing. This
 * limits the run-time flexibility since two different implementations of the
 * Writer interface will write to file two different kinds of object.
